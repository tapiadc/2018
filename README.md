#### Andrea Villanes Arellano
Despite the improvement in health conditions across the world, communicable diseases remain among the leading mortality causes in many countries. Combating communicable diseases depends on surveillance, preventive measures, outbreak investigation, and the establishment of control mechanisms. However, delays in obtaining country-level data of confirmed communicable disease cases, such as dengue fever, are prompting new efforts for short- to medium-term data. In this paper, we propose the creation of a surveillance tool for communicable diseases, with a focus on dengue fever, by analyzing data on public media. Our research offers the following novel contributions to text analytics, sentiment analysis, epidemiology, and visualization areas: (1) an alternative method for near real-time estimation of disease outbreak, spread, and response based on text analytics of public media sources like newspapers and social media; (2) identification of topics extracted from epidemiological news articles using text mining cluster analysis and topic analysis, which has not been used before in public health surveillance systems; (3) comparison of existing text mining classification techniques to accurately predict news article topics; (4) creation of a communicable disease sentiment dictionary by extending an existing dictionary with epidemiological terms and their associated sentiments, this sentiment dictionary can be used to estimate sentiment in the area of public health; (5) creation of a streamgraph inspired technique to display evolution of topics over time, incorporating known trends to allow for comparison; (6) integration of our cluster, categorization, sentiment analysis, and visualization techniques into an interactive web-based tool that allows domain experts to monitor dengue fever. This tool can be used as the basis for monitoring other communicable diseases in the future.

The work of community engagement performed by public officials in local government provides valuable opportunities for city residents to participate in governance. Technology stands to play an increasingly important role in mediating community engagement; however, currently the practices and relationships that constitute community engagement are understudied in HCI. Of particular importance is the role trust—either establishing trust, or more frequently, overcoming distrust between public officials and city residents. To address this challenge, my research seeks to understand how trust could inform the design of technology to support the work of community engagement performed by public officials in local government. My research first developed a broad, ethnographic understanding of how different domains within local government define and practice the work of engaging residents. Next, I developed a conceptual framework that describes how public officials operationalize trust in their engagement work. I then used design research techniques to develop strategies to guide HCI designers in developing tools to support community engagement based on the needs of trust. To further develop these strategies, I will develop technical interventions within several municipal entities in my local government. My research will culminate in a design framework that will inform development of technology for community engagement using trust.

This proposal describes my dissertation research into the role of diversity within collaborative video game design work. First, I explain why an examination of the daily work within this under-researched but quickly-growing field is needed, especially one that considers the role of diversity. Next, I review previous research on diversity, video games, and collaborative video game design work. I then identify three areas for considering diversity within this field: participation of underrepresented and marginalized groups, the structure of organizations, and collaborative work tool selection and use. Finally, I outline my qualitative research approach of a multi-sited ethnographic study in which I will conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews with video game designers about their daily collaborative work. This research is expected to contribute to the literatures on broadening diverse participation in technology design, human-computer interaction, organization studies, information work, and computer-supported cooperative work. Additionally, this study intends to help both current and future practitioners to better understand and support diversity within their work.

Patients with Discordant Chronic Comorbidities (DCCs) have multiple, often unrelated, chronic illnesses with opposing treatment instructions. These conditions can make it difficult for patients and healthcare providers to prioritize and manage the treatment of each individual disease. Despite the fact that challenges of managing multiple chronic diseases are well known in the literature, with an exception of work on the elimination diet, no other tools have been designed to address issues specific to care and treatment of type-2 diabetes concurrently with other diseases. In this Ph.D. work, I explore strategies and techniques to help patients with discordant chronic comorbidities (DCCs) better prioritize their treatment plans and communicate with multiple providers. I have completed; i) a 2 week photo-elicitation interviews to understand the needs and barriers to effective care and treatment of DCCs, ii) qualitative interviews with healthcare providers to understand their perspective on barriers to care and treatment of DCCs, iii) a focus group study with health care providers to brainstorm strategies and design directions for effective care and treatment of type-2 diabetes and DCCs, iv) the basic design sessions to evaluate DCCs care model. I intend to conduct a series of participatory design workshops with patients to design basic goal setting strategies and ways to achieve these goals.

Algebra is deemed necessary for access to all higher level math courses and for entrance into science, technology, engineering and math career fields. Despite its importance, many students nationwide are failing to perform well in this subject. Research suggests that this is due to a weakened arithmetic foundation needed before the transition to algebraic thinking. African-Americans, in particular, are underperforming in Algebra, and many other levels of math. This research explores the intersection of African-American culture and educational technology to strengthen the foundation of this demographic by improving pre-algebraic skills necessary for success in Algebra 1. Participation from 6th and 7th grade African-American students will be utilized throughout the design, implementation and evaluation of this novel technology. The research aims to offer insight on the design of culturally relevant educational technologies that will assist in narrowing the achievement gap.

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) are perceived as the "model minority" with a monolithic identity, in contrast to other marginalized racial groups in the United States. In reality, they are composed of different ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and political ideologies. My research employs social network analysis with qualitative research methods to explore, interpret, and visualize large collections of social media data. I seek to understand how Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) construct and express their identity in online communities and my dissertation research uncovers the ways in which AAPIs negotiate collective action in the context of online identity work.

Detection of security threats relies on the ability to collect, filter, and analyze diverse types of security data. Interactions derived from such data are usually modeled as networks aiming to provide a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of the underlying systems. Considering the temporal evolution of these networks is crucial to provide a more detailed characterization of the system's function. Irregularities, i.e., anomalies, in the general evolution of these networks are usually associated with critical and often undesired behavior. Anomaly detection techniques define the regular behavior of a system, against which unusual patterns are evaluated. Characterizing regular behavior is often a prerequisite to identify these anomalies. However, variations in the volume of interactions during a system's evolution under particular circumstances may be the norm. Identifying which stationary trends allow us to design reliable detection algorithms remains an open challenge. In this dissertation, we develop novel methods and tools for understanding and identifying anomalies in temporal networks. In particular, we focus on: (i) Graph mining: We show that surprising patterns about the composition of the community structure and k-shell decomposition of the graphs can be leveraged to detect anomalies; (ii) Graph robustness: We show how community detection-based methods are less biased against the density of edges in the system, providing a robust approach to detect anomalous behavior; (iii) Graph anomaly detection: We develop methods for detecting anomalies in different real-world scenarios, including (a) email interactions, (b) social media reaction to catastrophic events, (c) Internet route hijacking, and (d) user-system interactions in control version systems.
